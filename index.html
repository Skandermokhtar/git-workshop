        <strong>Steamed Plum Pudding</strong> 
        <p>Plum pudding has gone through a big transformation throughout the years. It was created in the 14th century as a savory dish made of beef, mutton, raisins and prunes. It became a dessert in the 16th century and is now made with brown sugar, currants, alcohol and spices. Some recipes use figs, hence the figgy pudding we sing about at Christmas.</p>
